# Portfolio Optimizer

This command line app takes a list of stock tickers and uses recent stock data to determine the optimal percentage of each stock for a portfolio. It also calculates the number of stocks you would need to buy at the stocks' current prices to build the portfolio. Stock portfolios are optimized on the largest sharpe ratio.
